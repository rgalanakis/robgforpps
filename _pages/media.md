For pictures, you can use what you find on the site.
Full resolution images are here: [github.com/rgalanakis/robgforpps/tree/main/assets/images/full](https://github.com/rgalanakis/robgforpps/tree/main/assets/images/full)

Campaign colors are Yellow (`#ffde59`), Blue (`#004aad`), and Green (`#42704a`).

Here are high-resolution campaign portraits you can download and use.
I prefer to be pictured in my Bike Bus gear but the plain ones are okay as well.
