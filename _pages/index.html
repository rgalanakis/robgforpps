            <i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>PPS and the City of Portland are both <strong>facing historic budget crises</strong>.
            Getting out the other side requires the <strong>strong fiscal stewardship</strong> and <strong>commitment to community</strong> I know Rob will provide.
            <strong>I&rsquo;m proud to endorse Rob G for Portland School Board, Zone 6.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="signature">&mdash; Portland City Councilor Mitch Green</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        My name is Rob Galanakis.
        Iâ€™m a parent of a 4th and 6th grader in PPS. Small business owner. Education, climate, and transportation advocate.
    </p>
    <p>
        PPS faces a crisis: <strong>despite nationally average funding, our results are near the bottom.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We cannot base our solutions on a bailout from Salem or a tax hike.
    </p>
    <p>
        We need <strong>inexpensive, urgent change</strong> based on deep <strong>community experience</strong> and <strong>policy expertise</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let&rsquo;s elect more than good intentions and unfunded promises.
        Elect the only candidate ready to start turning things around <strong>today</strong>.
    </p>
    <p><strong>On May 20th, vote for Rob &ldquo;G&rdquo; Galanakis, for your kids, schools, and city.</strong></p>

    <p>
        You may have already seen me biking around the city on my bright orange e-cargo bike, usually with my two kids.
        Or on a <a href="/bike-bus">Bike Bus</a> in my bright yellow jacket,
        or <a href="https://www.bike-summer.org/" target="_blank">Pedalpalooza</a> ride.
        Or I've helped you cross a busy street, corked for your march, or shopped at your store.
    </p>
    <p>If you see me, please say "Hi Rob G!"</p>
    <p>
        Or shoot me an email {% include email.html %},
        I love hearing from folks in our wonderful city.
