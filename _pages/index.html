    <h1>We deserve good schools, safe streets, and healthy communities.</h1>

    <p>
        My name is Rob Galanakis. I'm a proud Portland resident and PPS parent of two.
        I know Portland can again be a world-class city, and to do that we need world-class schools.
    </p>

    <p>But our public schools are in crisis, and we need more than the same approach that got us into this mess.</p>

    <p><strong>We need to be bold. We need to be creative.</strong></p>

    <p>Pointing fingers and begging for bailouts isn't going to rebuild a great public school system.</p>

    <p>We know our schools are under-funded, but we also need to answer: <strong>What can we do to help our kids thrive <em>today?</em></strong></p>

    <h1>Policy Matters</h1>
    <p>
        There's no silver bullet to this education crisis.
        It will take more ideas and creativity than we have offered so far.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>PPS needs to go beyond treating School Policy as <em>only</em> Education Policy.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>Because good School Policy means:</p>

    <h1>Meet Rob</h1>
    <p>
        You may have already seen me, biking around the city on my bright orange e-cargo bike, usually with my two kids.
        Or on a <a href="/bike-bus">Bike Bus</a> or <a href="https://www.bike-summer.org/" target="_blank">Pedalpalooza</a> ride.
        Or I've helped you cross a busy street, corked for your march, or shopped at your store.
    </p>
    <p>If you see me, please say hi!</p>
