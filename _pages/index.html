    <h1>Portlanders deserve good schools, safe streets, and healthy communities.</h1>
    <p>My name is Rob Galanakis. I&rsquo;m a proud Portland resident and PPS parent of two.</p>
    <p>
        My platform is called <strong>One City</strong>.
        I believe that, to get out of the multipronged crises we are in,
        <strong>we must act with urgency and creativity across our school, city, and county governments.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>Will this be a challenge? Yes. Will things go wrong? Yes. Is this idealistic? Yes.</p>
    <p>But it&rsquo;s also the only realistic option we have. We don&rsquo;t have the money, we don&rsquo;t have the time, we don&rsquo;t have the resources.</p>
    <p><strong>The only impossible approach is to keep the status quo.</strong></p>
    <p>
        I&rsquo;m running for Portland School Board to <strong>bring bold, creative leadership</strong>
        to a district that has for too long looked too internally.
    </p>
    <p>
        To add an engaged, willing partner ready to <strong>collaborate with the City and County</strong> on solving our hardest problems,
        including climate, housing, and transportation.
    </p>
    <p>To bring a sense of <strong>extreme urgency</strong> to the disasters we&rsquo;re leaving our kids in terms of their <strong>economic and environmental futures.</strong></p>
    <p>
        The challenges ahead are hard. The stakes are high.
        <br />But we don&rsquo;t have a choice.
        <br />We only have one planet.
        <br />One school district.
        <br />One Portland.
    </p>
    <p><strong>One City.</strong></p>

    <h1>One City</h1>
    <p>Our problems have been decades in the making, and they won&rsquo;t be fixed overnight.</p>
    <p>
        PPS is part of <strong>One City</strong>.
        That means we need to look at problem solving from the perspective of the city as a whole,
        and expect our partners do the same.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>PPS must work with its partners if we want:</strong>

    <p>
        You may have already seen me, biking around the city on my bright orange e-cargo bike, usually with my two kids.
        Or on a <a href="/bike-bus">Bike Bus</a> in my bright yellow jacket,
        or <a href="https://www.bike-summer.org/" target="_blank">Pedalpalooza</a> ride.
        Or I've helped you cross a busy street, corked for your march, or shopped at your store.

    <p>If you see me, please say "Hi Rob G!"</p>
