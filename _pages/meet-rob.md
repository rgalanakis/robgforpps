# PPS Parent, Community Advocate

I'm Rob Galanakis (pronounced _gah-lah-NAH-keese_). I've lived in Southeast Portland since 2014
and am the dad of a 4th and 6th grader in PPS. My daughter insists I mention that we have two pet rats.
My wife is a unionized hospital nurse at our local hospital. 

I'm a leader at [BikeBusPDX](https://bikebuspdx.org), President of my school's PTA, PYSA soccer coach, and on my Neighborhood Association board.
I'm also an active member of other climate, transportation, and housing organizations. I'm a small business owner and have run two other businesses before my current one.

My family moved to Portland from [Reykjav√≠k, Iceland](https://www.robg3d.com/2012/11/taking-your-dog-to-iceland/), where we lived for 3 years and our first child was born.
When we moved back to the US, we chose the city that most closely aligned with the values of a **family-friendly interdependence**
that we picked up abroad.

In Portland, I was an executive/co-founder at two companies ([Cozy](https://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/2018/11/cozy_portland_tech_startup_sel.html){:target="_blank"} and [Local MilkRun](https://www.koin.com/news/health/coronavirus/milkrun-delivery-connects-portland-metro-with-local-food/){:target="_blank"}) before founding my own consultancy ([Lithic Tech](https://lithic.tech){:target="_blank"}).

**In 2021, I rode my first e-bike and it changed my life.** Bikes weren't for me, due to asthma and balance issues. But since 2022, I've done nearly all local trips by cargo bike: everything from school and groceries to bringing home Christmas trees and chest freezers.

Experiencing Portland on two wheels, especially with my kids in tow, changed my relationship with my community.

Seeing how this one relatively inexpensive thing &mdash; an electric cargo bike that cost as much as a car repair &mdash; could improve my life
opened up a world of possibilities, where better choices in one area create gains in another.

I got to know my neighbors. Became healthier. Polluted less. Didn't waste time in traffic or parking. My kids loved going on errands. Shopped more locally. Saved more money. Had more fun. Went out more. Met more friends. Engaged in collective joy. Found tangible ways to make the world better.

Just switching to a bike did all this. Because **all of our problems are related.**

Our schools are struggling, yet our tax burden is high.

Our infrastructure is crumbling, but we're facing record utility bills.

Communication is instant, but we're profoundly lonely.

Our planet is burning, but we're emitting more carbon than ever.

**It's easy to point figures and wonder what this has to do with PPS or public schools.**

**But that's like asking what your hands have to do with your feet.**
Different roles, but part of the same body.

We can't sit by and try to solve things one at a time. **Solving these problems is a job for every public entity.**

It's time to pursue bold and creative solutions at PPS.
Our kids, our city, our world, cannot wait.
