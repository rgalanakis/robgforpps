# Yard Signs & Bike Pennants

What would an election be without yard signs? We hope you'll help get the word out. We can collect the sign
after the campaign to make sure it's responsibly recycled.

We also have a limited set of pennants available for your bike!

<a href="https://forms.gle/xvREEnHBhnNTSRT26" target="_blank">Fill out the form</a> to request a yard sign or pennant, and someone from the campaign will deliver it by bike as soon as they're available.

# Donate

**I will not spend any money on large tech platforms.** They are hurting society and if democracy is to survive,
we need to find better ways to spend hard-earned dollars.

Donations will go to:

- Physical expenses, like yard signs, tshirts, stickers, etc.
- Expertise that should be compensated, when necessary.
- Paying for experiences of collective joy, like kid-focused bike rides and Walk+Roll activities.
